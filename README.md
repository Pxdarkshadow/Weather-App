# Weather-App
A simple and responsive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data based on city names entered by the user. Includes geolocation via the Geocoding API, displays weather icons and descriptions, and handles empty or invalid input gracefully.
